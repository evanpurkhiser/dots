# dots - A cascading dot file management tool
#
# The dots utility is used to manage a grouping of dotfiles for various
# environments and UNIX like platforms. The primary goal of this utility it to
# facilitate the logical separation of dotfiles and providing the ability to
# 'compile' this organization into a usable directory tree of files.
#
# DIRECTORY STRUCTURE AND GROUPINGS
#
# By default configuration files should be stored two subdirectories deep from
# the location where this script is located. For example `machines/desktop/`
# could be used to store configuration files specific to a users desktop
# machine. The exception to this is the `base` group, which is only one
# directory deep.
#
# You may have as many configuration groupings as you would like.
#
# CASCADING OF CONFIGURATION FILES
#
# If two groups are specified for a configuration environment that both contain
# the same configuration file, then the file will 'cascade'. What this means is
# that the file in the second group will be appended to the first group.
#
# OVERRIDING AND EXTENDING
#
# The cascading logic can be modified by 'overriding' or 'extending' a file.
#
# Overriding a file allows you to force configuration files that exist earlier
# in the configuration environment groups list to be discarded instead of being
# used as the base for a configuration file to be appended to. For example:
#
#    base/bash/bashrc
#    machines/desktop/bash/bashrc.override
#
#    groups = ['base', 'machines/desktop']
#
# Instead of the machines/desktop version of the bashrc file being amended to
# the base bashrc file, it will simply discard the base version of the file.
#
# Extending a file allows you to specify 'explicit append points' in a file.
# This way instead of having a cascading file be appended to the end, it could
# be appended somewhere else. Continuing from the last example (without the
# .override):
#
# If the `base/bash/bashrc` file contains the symbol `!!@@' in the file, this is
# where the `machines/desktop/bash/bashrc` file would be appended.
#
# You may also use 'named append points'. This allows you to insert 'fragment'
# files into a file. For example, say we have the following files:
#
#    base/bash/bashrc
#    base/bash/bashrc.aliases
#
# If somewhere within the `base/bash/bashrc` file we have the symbol
# '!!@@aliases' then the `bashrc.aliases` file would be appended at.
#
# Fragment files are subject to all of the same logic described above
# (extending, append points, and even named append points)
#
# INSTALLATION SCRIPTS
#
# Each configuration file may have an associated .install script. This is a
# script that will be executed when the configuration file is installed.
# Remember that configuration files are only installed if they differ from the
# currently installed configuration file. So install scripts will only be run on
# updates or first installs of the configuration file.

USAGE="""dots - A dot file pre-processor and installer

dots [-c CONFIG] COMMAND [options]

The following commands and options are available:

-c       Specify the file to load and save configuration environment groups
         lists to. If not specified the default configuration file will be used

groups   Manage available configuration groups

         known    List all configuration groups that are available to be
                  specified for a configuration environment list

         current  Get the current configuration environment groups

         set      Specify a space separated list of valid configuration groups
                  to enable for this environment

         clear    Remove all current groups from the configuration file

diff     Get the difference between the source files, and currently installed
         configuration files. This should be though of as a representation of
         'what will change' when you install. This will use git-diff to do the
         diffing, thus you may pass any valid git-diff options such as
         --shortstat

         [PATHS]  A list of one or more files or paths to check. If this is
                  omitted then the entire tree of source configuration files
                  will be diffed

files    List out all of the currently tracked configuration files for the
         currently set configration groups

         [PATHS]  A list of one or more paths to filter the list by

install  Compile and install one or more configuration files into a location.
         If no specific paths are specified then the entire source tree will
         be installed into the specified location and after-install scripts
         will be executed

         [PATHS]  A list of one or more files or paths to install into the
                  specified location. If omitted the entire tree will be
                  installed

         -l       Specify the location to install the configuration files to.
                  If omitted the default XDG_CONFIG_HOME path will be used
